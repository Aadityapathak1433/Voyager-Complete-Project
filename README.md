VOYAGER ia a travel planning platform which is built using ANGULAR for FrontEnd.
Team Voyager have used Spring Boot for BackEnd.
Team Voyager have used MySQL as Database.

As we have used Angular as FrontEnd and MySQL as BackEnd, only the FrontEnd part and our user friendly UI would be accessible, not the BackEnd part because of limited resources.
As Team Voyager moves on with this platform, we're focused and determined to make changes according to the customer requirements.
